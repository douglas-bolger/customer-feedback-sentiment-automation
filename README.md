# Customer Feedback Sentiment Automation

AI-powered workflow that collects customer feedback, applies sentiment classification using a Large Language Model (LLM), and stores structured output in Google Sheets for operational visibility.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates applied AI automation by integrating a feedback intake system with LLM-based sentiment analysis. The workflow automatically classifies customer feedback as positive or negative, generates concise summaries, and stores structured results in Google Sheets.

---

## Problem

Customer feedback was collected manually without structured categorization, making it difficult to identify sentiment trends or generate summary insights efficiently.

---

## Solution

Designed and implemented an automated workflow that:

- Captures customer feedback submissions  
- Sends input to an LLM for sentiment classification  
- Generates concise AI-powered summaries  
- Categorizes responses as positive or negative  
- Stores structured output in Google Sheets for reporting and analysis

## Architecture (High-Level Flow)

1. Customer submits feedback form  
2. Make automation workflow triggers  
3. Feedback text is sent to LLM API  
4. LLM returns structured sentiment classification + summary  
5. Data is logged into Google Sheets
